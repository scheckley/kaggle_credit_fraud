This is my hobby ML project looking at the Kaggle credit card fraud dataset.

Analysis is influenced by these sources:
* https://www.kaggle.com/joparga3/in-depth-skewed-data-classif-93-recall-acc-now
    
* http://contrib.scikit-learn.org/imbalanced-learn/stable/auto_examples/combine/plot_smote_enn.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-combine-plot-smote-enn-py

My best result thus far is 96% accuracy using a random forest classifier.
